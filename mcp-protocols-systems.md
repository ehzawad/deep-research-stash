# Message (Model) Communication Protocol (MCP): Architecture, Design, and Integration

**Message (Model) Communication Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard (introduced by Anthropic in late 2024) for connecting AI systems (especially Large Language Model applications) with external data sources, tools, and other agents. In essence, MCP defines a *universal interface* – often likened to a **“USB-C port for AI”** – that allows any AI-powered application (the *host*) to “plug in” any number of external resources via standardized connectors (the *servers*) ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#:~:text=MCP%20is%20an%20open%20protocol,different%20data%20sources%20and%20tools)) ([MCP Explained: How This AI Protocol Saves 99% of Your Time | by Sebastian Buzdugan | Mar, 2025 | Stackademic](https://blog.stackademic.com/mcp-explained-how-this-ai-protocol-saves-99-of-your-time-572971529ca8?source=collection_archive---------8-----------------------#:~:text=MCP%20is%20an%20open%20protocol,LLMs)). This standardization aims to replace ad-hoc, fragmented integrations with a single protocol, making it easier to build context-rich AI applications that can access live data and perform actions in the world ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=MCP%20addresses%20this%20challenge,to%20the%20data%20they%20need)) ([MCP Explained: How This AI Protocol Saves 99% of Your Time | by Sebastian Buzdugan | Mar, 2025 | Stackademic](https://blog.stackademic.com/mcp-explained-how-this-ai-protocol-saves-99-of-your-time-572971529ca8?source=collection_archive---------8-----------------------#:~:text=At%20the%20heart%20of%20MCP,them%20adaptable%20for%20various%20environments)).

MCP is built on a **client–server architecture** with clearly defined roles and communication patterns. It was motivated by practical needs in AI agent development: LLM-based agents often require access to up-to-date information or the ability to use tools, but prior to MCP, developers had to implement custom bridges for every data source or API. MCP’s design addresses this by providing a single, extensible protocol for *all* such integrations ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Instead%20of%20maintaining%20separate%20connectors,with%20a%20more%20sustainable%20architecture)) ([MCP Explained: How This AI Protocol Saves 99% of Your Time | by Sebastian Buzdugan | Mar, 2025 | Stackademic](https://blog.stackademic.com/mcp-explained-how-this-ai-protocol-saves-99-of-your-time-572971529ca8?source=collection_archive---------8-----------------------#:~:text=Before%20MCP%3A)). Below, we break down the MCP architecture, interface design, integration strategies, and how it compares to related protocols. We also explore the historical context, design rationale, and real-world usage insights – providing a comprehensive guide for researchers and developers looking to build their own MCP clients or servers from scratch.

## MCP Architecture: Clients, Servers, and Hosts

MCP follows a classic **client–server model** tailored to LLM-based agents. At a high level, an *LLM application* (for example, a chat assistant or AI-enabled IDE) acts as the **host**, which initiates connections to one or more **MCP servers**. Each MCP server is a lightweight program that exposes a specific dataset or capability (e.g. a database, a web service, a filesystem, etc.) through the protocol. The host uses an internal **MCP client** component to manage each 1:1 connection with an MCP server ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#:~:text=,MCP%20servers%20can%20connect%20to)) ([Core architecture - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#:~:text=MCP%20follows%20a%20client,where)). In other words, the “client” is the connector logic running on the host side, and the “server” is the external integration service. The host may run multiple MCP clients in parallel – one for each server it connects to. This arrangement is analogous to a computer (host) using multiple device drivers to interface with different peripherals, all through a standardized port (see **Figure 1** below).

 ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained - Composio](https://composio.dev/blog/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained/)) *Figure 1: Conceptual diagram of the MCP architecture. The MCP host application (right) uses **MCP client** connectors to interface with multiple **MCP servers** (left), each of which connects to a different external service or local resource. This is analogous to a laptop using a universal port/hub (MCP) to connect to various devices (Slack, Gmail, Calendar, local files, etc.).* ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Instead%20of%20maintaining%20separate%20connectors,with%20a%20more%20sustainable%20architecture)) ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained - Composio](https://composio.dev/blog/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained/#:~:text=It%20provides%20the%20universal%20rules,Databases%2C%20Gmail%2C%20Slack%2C%20etc))

**Host / LLM Application:** The host is the top-level application or agent orchestrator that leverages an LLM. Examples include the Claude Desktop app, IDE extensions, chatbots, or custom AI orchestration frameworks ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#:~:text=,MCP%20servers%20can%20connect%20to)) ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=data%20sources%20and%20tools,io)). The host is in charge of coordinating interactions with the user and the LLM. It initiates connections to MCP servers to gain access to external information or tools needed to fulfill user requests. In practice, the host will load or spawn one or more MCP client instances (often via an SDK) and establish communication with servers (locally or over a network).

**MCP Client:** The client is the component running within the host that implements the MCP protocol on the client side. Each MCP client handles communication with one MCP server. The client registers handlers to respond to server messages (requests/notifications) and can send its own requests to the server ([Core architecture - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#:~:text=class%20Protocol,Result%3E%29%3A%20void)) ([Core architecture - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#:~:text=Promise)). Conceptually, the MCP client is like a “driver” or “connector” that translates between the host’s needs and the server’s provided interface. The client may live as a thread or process within the host’s runtime. Notably, the host can maintain *multiple* client connections simultaneously (to different servers), enabling an AI agent to draw from many sources at once.

**MCP Server:** An MCP server is a service (which can be a separate process, container, or remote service) that provides a specific set of **capabilities** to the client. These capabilities are standardized by MCP and fall into three categories: **Tools**, **Resources**, and **Prompts** (explained in detail below). In effect, an MCP server “exposes” certain data or functions in a format the LLM agent can use ([Core architecture - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#:~:text=,tools%2C%20and%20prompts%20to%20clients)) ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=,and%20Notifications%20between%20clients%20and)). For example, an MCP server might expose a database’s content as *resources*, or expose an email-sending function as a *tool*. Servers declare what they offer, handle incoming requests from the client (e.g. “execute this tool” or “fetch this resource”), and return results over the protocol. They are designed to be **stateless connectors** – often wrapping some underlying API or database – rather than monolithic services. Because each server adheres to the common MCP spec, a host can connect to new servers without custom code, as long as it speaks MCP.

**Communication and Transport:** MCP communication is message-based and built on top of **JSON-RPC 2.0**, a lightweight RPC (remote procedure call) format using JSON ([Core architecture - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#:~:text=The%20transport%20layer%20handles%20the,MCP%20supports%20multiple%20transport%20mechanisms)) ([Specification - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26#:~:text=The%20protocol%20uses%20JSON,messages%20to%20establish%20communication%20between)). Every message (client-to-server or server-to-client) follows JSON-RPC structure with methods, params, and (for requests) an ID for matching responses. This choice was a design decision to leverage a well-understood standard for structured messaging, enabling *language-agnostic* implementation and integration with existing tooling ([Core architecture - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#:~:text=The%20transport%20layer%20handles%20the,MCP%20supports%20multiple%20transport%20mechanisms)) ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained - Composio](https://composio.dev/blog/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained/#:~:text=A%20more%20relevant%20example%20could,the%20ecosystem%20of%20AI%20applications)). The protocol is transport-agnostic: it can run over different underlying transports. The current specification defines two primary transport mechanisms ([Core architecture - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#:~:text=servers,mechanisms)):

- **Standard I/O (stdio)**: Suitable for local servers launched as child processes. The client and server read/write JSON-RPC messages via stdin/stdout streams. This transport is simple and ideal for running connectors on the same machine (e.g., Claude Desktop launching a local Python MCP server).
- **HTTP + SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: Suitable for remote or long-running servers. The client issues HTTP POST requests for sending messages to the server, and the server uses an SSE stream (over an HTTP response) to push messages back to the client ([Core architecture - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#:~:text=1)). This allows asynchronous, bidirectional communication via web-friendly protocols. For example, an MCP server could run as a web service on a different host, and the LLM app connects to it via HTTP. (WebSocket support is not in the spec yet, but may be considered in the future ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=,png)).)

Regardless of transport, **all MCP messages are JSON** and conform to the MCP schemas. The connection is **stateful** (maintains context like open resource handles or ongoing interactions) and can support streaming results (e.g. a tool that streams partial output to the client). The first step of an MCP connection is usually a **capability handshake**: the client and server exchange information about what features each supports (tools, resources, prompts, etc.) and negotiate details like protocol version ([Specification - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26#:~:text=Base%20Protocol)) ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=,Insights%3A%20%40pirroh%20reflects%20on%20MCP%27s)). This is analogous to how a language server and IDE negotiate capabilities in LSP, and it ensures that both sides know what the other can do.

**Security Considerations:** Because MCP can grant an AI broad access to data and execution, security is a core architectural concern. The protocol itself provides the hooks for secure handling, though enforcement is up to implementations. Key principles include *user consent* for any data access or tool use, *data privacy* (hosts must not send data to servers without permission), *tool safety* (treat all tool descriptions as untrusted by default), and *LLM action approval* (the user should approve any autonomous actions the model tries to perform via MCP) ([Specification - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26#:~:text=Key%20Principles)) ([Specification - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26#:~:text=,LLM%20Sampling%20Controls)). For example, a well-designed host will prompt the user to authorize an MCP server before it can read their files or execute a system command, and possibly sandbox what the server can do. These measures are crucial in real deployments to prevent misuse of the power MCP gives to an AI agent. (In practice, the Claude Desktop app currently requires users to manually enable each MCP server and re-confirm on each restart, as an early safety measure ([Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Glama](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart#:~:text=As%20for%20Claude%20Desktop%2C)).)

**MCP in Operation:** Once a host (client) is connected to a server, the server can offer *resources* (data) or *tools* (operations), and the two sides exchange JSON-RPC **requests** (which expect a response) and **notifications** (one-way messages) accordingly ([Core architecture - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#:~:text=class%20Protocol,Result%3E%29%3A%20void)) ([Core architecture - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Send%20requests%20and%20await,T)). For instance, the client might send a `ListResources` request to the server to enumerate what data is available, or the server might send a `ResourceUpdated` notification to inform the client of a change. The protocol defines standard message schemas for these interactions (detailed in the MCP specification), so that any compliant client/server can understand each other. In many cases, the pattern is driven by the *LLM’s needs* – e.g. the LLM (via the host’s logic) decides it needs certain info and triggers a request to the server, or the LLM decides to invoke a tool, which the host translates into an MCP call.

One important concept is **“roots”**, which are essentially scope hints that the client can give to the server to limit its focus ([Roots - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/roots#:~:text=What%20are%20Roots%3F)) ([Roots - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/roots#:~:text=When%20a%20client%20supports%20roots%2C,it)). For example, a host could specify a root URI like `file:///home/user/project` when connecting to a filesystem server, indicating the server should only consider that directory. Roots help scope the context (especially for large data sources) and mirror how an IDE might open a specific workspace for a language server. They are part of capability negotiation – the client declares supported roots and shares root URIs, and the server uses them as boundaries for operations ([Roots - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/roots#:~:text=A%20root%20is%20a%20URI,valid%20URI%20including%20HTTP%20URLs)) ([Roots - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/roots#:~:text=When%20a%20client%20supports%20roots%2C,it)). This is a design choice to enhance **clarity and security**, ensuring the server doesn’t roam over unrelated data.

In summary, MCP’s architecture cleanly separates the **LLM agent logic (host)** from the **domain-specific integration logic (servers)** via a common protocol. This decoupling means improvements or additions on one side don’t require changes on the other side, as long as the protocol remains consistent. The use of JSON-RPC and an LSP-inspired capability model were deliberate decisions to make MCP **language-agnostic**, extensible, and familiar to developers of similar systems ([Specification - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26#:~:text=MCP%20takes%20some%20inspiration%20from,additional%20context%20and%20tools%20into)). Figure 2 provides a schematic breakdown of how an MCP client and server interact and what each side contributes.

 ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp)) *Figure 2: MCP client–server interaction and feature breakdown. The **MCP server** exposes three types of capabilities – **Tools**, **Resources**, and **Prompts** – to the **MCP client**. Tools are *model-controlled* functions (the LLM decides when to invoke them), Resources are *application-controlled* data (exposed to the model as context), and Prompts are *user/developer-controlled* templates or instructions. The MCP client (host side) invokes tools, queries resources, and interpolates prompts as needed ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=,and%20Notifications%20between%20clients%20and)) ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=,yet)).* 

## MCP Features: Tools, Resources, Prompts, and More

MCP’s design revolves around **standardized interface features** that an MCP server can provide. The core features are **Resources**, **Prompts**, **Tools**, and one client-initiated feature called **Sampling**. Each feature type corresponds to a particular integration strategy for enhancing an AI model’s capabilities:

- **Resources:** These are pieces of data or context that the server makes available to the client ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=,and%20Notifications%20between%20clients%20and)). A resource could be a file’s contents, a database record, an API response, a spreadsheet, etc. Each resource is identified by a URI and can contain text or binary data ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=,and%20Notifications%20between%20clients%20and)). Resources are typically *read-only* from the model’s perspective – they inform the model’s knowledge without the model altering them (for write operations, Tools are used). For example, a “Google Drive” MCP server might expose documents or PDFs as resources so that an AI writing assistant can fetch and quote from them. In practice, the client can request a resource (e.g., “give me the content of file X”), iterate over lists of resources, or be notified when a resource changes. This feature addresses the **context-sharing** problem: instead of fine-tuning or embedding all relevant data, the model can retrieve what it needs on the fly via MCP.

- **Prompts:** Prompts in MCP are predefined templates or workflow scripts that the server can provide to structure the AI’s interactions ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=or%20binary%20data.%20,and%20Notifications%20between%20clients%20and)). Think of prompts as *reusable query or response patterns*. For instance, a server might offer a prompt template for “summarize this document” or a multi-step prompt for guiding the model through a database query. These are often multi-turn or complex prompts that have been crafted for specific tasks, which the client (or user) can invoke without writing them from scratch each time. Prompts help standardize complex interactions – e.g., an “Analytics” server might have a prompt for doing data analysis given a dataset resource. The rationale is to share best-practice prompting (including chain-of-thought or tool usage patterns) as part of the integration. A real example is Claude’s integration in an IDE: it could use an MCP server that provides a “refactor code” prompt template which Claude then fills and executes.

- **Tools:** Tools are perhaps the most crucial feature – they represent **actions or functions** the model can invoke to affect the outside world or retrieve information actively ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=,and%20Notifications%20between%20clients%20and)). In MCP, a Tool is typically defined by a name, a description (what it does, inputs/outputs), and possibly a schema for its parameters. The server **registers** the tools it provides, and the client makes them known to the LLM (usually by including the tool names/descriptions in the model’s context, so the model can decide to use them) ([Complementary Protocols for Agentic Systems : Understanding Google’s A2A & Anthropic’s MCP | by Ali Arsanjani | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@dr-arsanjani/complementary-protocols-for-agentic-systems-understanding-googles-a2a-anthropic-s-mcp-47f5e66b6486#:~:text=Functionally%2C%20MCP%20provides%20the%20blueprint,tool%20is%20executed%20by%20the)) ([Complementary Protocols for Agentic Systems : Understanding Google’s A2A & Anthropic’s MCP | by Ali Arsanjani | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@dr-arsanjani/complementary-protocols-for-agentic-systems-understanding-googles-a2a-anthropic-s-mcp-47f5e66b6486#:~:text=To%20illustrate%2C%20consider%20a%20Personal,them%20back%20into%20the%20model%E2%80%99s)). When the LLM (during a conversation or task) decides to use a tool, it outputs a structured request (following MCP’s format) that indicates which tool and with what parameters; the host captures this and sends a corresponding JSON-RPC request to the MCP server to execute the tool ([Complementary Protocols for Agentic Systems : Understanding Google’s A2A & Anthropic’s MCP | by Ali Arsanjani | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@dr-arsanjani/complementary-protocols-for-agentic-systems-understanding-googles-a2a-anthropic-s-mcp-47f5e66b6486#:~:text=structures%20its%20response,for%20further%20processing%20or%20summarization)) ([Complementary Protocols for Agentic Systems : Understanding Google’s A2A & Anthropic’s MCP | by Ali Arsanjani | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@dr-arsanjani/complementary-protocols-for-agentic-systems-understanding-googles-a2a-anthropic-s-mcp-47f5e66b6486#:~:text=check_calendar%20tool%20according%20to%20MCP,back%20into%20the%20model%E2%80%99s%20context)). The server runs the function (e.g., “search the web”, “send an email”, “retrieve database records”) and returns the result. The host then feeds that result back into the LLM’s context, allowing the model to continue with new information ([Complementary Protocols for Agentic Systems : Understanding Google’s A2A & Anthropic’s MCP | by Ali Arsanjani | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@dr-arsanjani/complementary-protocols-for-agentic-systems-understanding-googles-a2a-anthropic-s-mcp-47f5e66b6486#:~:text=afternoon%3F%E2%80%9D%2C%20the%20PAAS%20orchestrator%20employs,back%20into%20the%20model%E2%80%99s%20context)) ([Complementary Protocols for Agentic Systems : Understanding Google’s A2A & Anthropic’s MCP | by Ali Arsanjani | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@dr-arsanjani/complementary-protocols-for-agentic-systems-understanding-googles-a2a-anthropic-s-mcp-47f5e66b6486#:~:text=check_calendar%20tool%20according%20to%20MCP,back%20into%20the%20model%E2%80%99s%20context)). In essence, Tools turn the LLM into an agent that can perform multi-step operations: the model’s output can be not just an answer, but an *action request*. This is analogous to OpenAI’s function-calling or LangChain’s tools, but MCP standardizes it over a protocol. Tools are *model-controlled* (the model triggers them) but *user-approved* (the host should confirm dangerous actions). They can range from simple (e.g., a math calculator) to complex (e.g., orchestrating a transaction across systems). For example, an MCP server for Slack might provide a “send_message(channel, text)” tool, and if the user asks the AI to post a Slack update, the model can invoke that tool through MCP to actually send the message.

- **Sampling:** This is a less common feature and operates in the opposite direction – it allows an **MCP server to request the client to invoke the LLM** for some sub-task ([Specification - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26#:~:text=Clients%20may%20offer%20the%20following,feature%20to%20servers)). In other words, the server can ask the host to perform a language-model “sampling” (generation) with a given prompt. This might sound circular, but it’s useful for advanced workflows: for example, a server might implement an **agent loop** or decision-making process that occasionally needs the LLM to produce an output (perhaps to rank options or generate text that the server then uses). MCP’s *Sampling* feature lets servers leverage the LLM itself as a tool (via the client). To keep things safe, the protocol ensures the server doesn’t get to see the entire model prompt (only specific allowed parts) ([Specification - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26#:~:text=4)), and the user must consent to such actions. An example use-case: an MCP server might be an “AI strategist” that, when given a complex task, breaks it down but asks the LLM (through the client) to handle some creative subtasks; the server then uses those results to decide on a final action. Sampling essentially enables **server-initiated AI calls** – adding recursive or meta-cognitive abilities in an agent system. This feature is optional and is typically used only in specialized scenarios (one community-built client, `fast-agent`, implements full support for Sampling to allow *agents-calling-agents* behaviors ([Example Clients - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients#:~:text=agents%20Emacs%20Mcp%E2%9D%8C%E2%9D%8C%E2%9C%85%E2%9D%8C%E2%9D%8CSupports%20tools%20in,list%20and%20lookup%20through%20tools))).

In addition to these main features, the MCP protocol defines utilities for **configuration negotiation**, **progress tracking**, **cancellation**, **error reporting**, and **logging** ([Specification - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26#:~:text=Additional%20Utilities)) – all important for robust integrations. For instance, if a tool action is taking a long time, the server can send progress updates or the client can send a cancel request. Errors are reported in a standardized way (using JSON-RPC error fields plus MCP-specific error codes), so clients can handle failures gracefully (e.g., by informing the user or retrying). Logging messages can be exchanged for debugging.

**Interface Implementation:** Developers implement MCP clients/servers typically using official SDKs or the reference specification. Anthropic has open-sourced SDKs in multiple languages (Python, TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, C#, Rust, Swift, etc.) ([Model Context Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol#:~:text=%2A%20rust)) ([Model Context Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol#:~:text=51%20%20Updated%20Apr%2019%2C,2025)), making it easier to build compliant integrations. For example, using the Python SDK, one can create an MCP server by subclassing or configuring a server class, then defining handlers for various request types. Here’s a **simplified code snippet** illustrating part of an MCP server’s implementation (from an example *Brave Search* server):

```typescript
// In a TypeScript MCP server:
server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {
    return { tools: [ WEB_SEARCH_TOOL, LOCAL_SEARCH_TOOL ] };
});

// Define what WEB_SEARCH_TOOL looks like:
const WEB_SEARCH_TOOL = {
    name: "brave_web_search",
    description: "Performs a web search using the Brave Search API, ideal for general queries, news, articles, ...",
    parameters: { /* JSON schema for tool parameters like query string */ }
    // ... other tool metadata
};
```

*Explanation:* When the MCP client requests the list of available tools (using the standardized `ListTools` request), this handler responds with an array containing two tools: `brave_web_search` and a `local_search` tool ([Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Glama](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart#:~:text=Internally%2C%20the%20server%20implementation%20defines,their%20availability%20to%20the%20client)) ([Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Glama](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart#:~:text=server.setRequestHandler%28ListToolsRequestSchema%2C%20async%20%28%29%20%3D,WEB_SEARCH_TOOL%2C%20LOCAL_SEARCH_TOOL%5D%2C)). Each tool is described by a name and description that will ultimately be visible to the LLM. The MCP framework ensures that once the client receives this, it can inform the LLM that these tools exist. Later, if the LLM chooses to invoke `"brave_web_search"` with some query, the host will send an `InvokeTool` request to the server, which the server routes to the actual implementation of that tool (e.g., calling Brave’s API) and returns the results. This pattern – registering tools and handling requests – is repeated for resources and prompts (e.g., a handler for `GetResource` or `ListResources` would be provided). The SDK abstracts the JSON-RPC details so the developer can work with higher-level schemas and typed requests.

On the client side, implementing an MCP client is often about integrating it with the host’s runtime. For example, a client might be implemented in an IDE: one would use the MCP client SDK to connect to a server (specifying transport details like a subprocess command or a URL), declare what features the client can handle, and then write logic for how to incorporate the server’s outputs into the LLM’s prompt/response cycle. The SDK provides a **Protocol** class that developers use to send requests or listen for notifications in an asynchronous manner ([Core architecture - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#:~:text=class%20Protocol,Result%3E%29%3A%20void)) ([Core architecture - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Send%20requests%20and%20await,T)). Many clients will simply use the SDK’s default behaviors: e.g., automatically populate the LLM’s context with any *resources* labeled as “active” or automatically include prompt templates provided by servers at certain steps. The details vary by application, but the key point is that because MCP is standardized, **the same client code can talk to any MCP server** – you don’t hardcode for Slack vs GitHub vs a database; you just request tools or resources and get them, regardless of source.

**Dynamic Discovery:** A powerful aspect of MCP is that clients can **discover available servers and their capabilities at runtime**. There’s no need to predefine in the agent what integrations exist – the protocol includes mechanisms for the client to query what a server can do, and for servers to advertise their capabilities. For example, when a connection is established, the server will send the list of tools, resource types, and prompts it offers. The LLM can then reason about those. In practice, this means if you “plug in” a new MCP server (say for a CRM system) into your AI assistant, the assistant can immediately leverage it without new coding – it queries the server, finds it has say a `lookup_customer` tool or some resources like “customer records”, and can start using them. This **plug-and-play extensibility** is a major improvement over previous approaches where each integration was custom-coded and static. As one analysis noted, *“AI agents automatically detect available MCP servers and their capabilities, without hard-coded integrations”*, which offers flexibility traditional one-off APIs can’t match ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=One%20striking%20feature%20is%20MCP%E2%80%99s,flexibility%20traditional%20approaches%20can%27t%20match)).

In summary, MCP’s feature set and interface design were crafted to support a wide range of agent integration needs in a uniform way. By covering data (resources), predefined prompts, and action tools – and even recursive AI calls – MCP attempts to be a **comprehensive integration layer** for augmenting LLMs. The trade-off of this generality is that both the client and server implementations need to handle a fair amount of complexity (capability negotiation, maintaining state, ensuring security). However, the availability of SDKs, reference servers, and best-practice guidelines (e.g., security checklists) are aimed at smoothing this complexity for developers.

## Design Rationale and Historical Context

MCP was born out of the recognition that LLM-driven applications were **“trapped behind information silos and legacy systems”**, with every new data source requiring custom integration code ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=As%20AI%20assistants%20gain%20mainstream,connected%20systems%20difficult%20to%20scale)). As AI assistants grew more capable, the lack of easy connectivity to external data became a bottleneck – fine-tuning models or manually feeding context only went so far. The **motivation behind MCP’s design** was to create a universal solution to this problem of *connecting AI to the data and tools it needs*. In Anthropic’s words, MCP is meant to *“replace fragmented integrations with a single protocol”*, yielding a more scalable and reliable way to give AI access to the right context ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=MCP%20addresses%20this%20challenge,to%20the%20data%20they%20need)) ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Instead%20of%20maintaining%20separate%20connectors,with%20a%20more%20sustainable%20architecture)).

Historically, this vision of a unifying protocol has precedents. The analogy to the **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** is frequently made: just as LSP standardized how editors and development tools integrate programming language features (linters, autocomplete, etc.) via a common protocol ([Specification - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26#:~:text=MCP%20takes%20some%20inspiration%20from,additional%20context%20and%20tools%20into)) ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=,For%20implementation%20guides%20and%20examples)), MCP aims to standardize how AI applications integrate external knowledge and operations. The designers explicitly drew inspiration from LSP’s success in creating an ecosystem where, for example, a new language server could be written once and work in any LSP-compatible IDE ([Specification - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26#:~:text=MCP%20takes%20some%20inspiration%20from,additional%20context%20and%20tools%20into)). Similarly, an MCP server for, say, *Jira* (issue tracker) could be built once and then used by any MCP-compatible agent (Claude, GPT-based, etc.) to enable query or update of tickets.

Another influence is the general **microservices architecture** and separation of concerns. By treating each integration as an independent server with its own API or data backend (encapsulated behind MCP), the system follows a microservice-like design where each connector can be developed, scaled, and secured independently. This was likely informed by decades of enterprise integration practices. Cisco’s Outshift team (who developed a related agent protocol) notes that MCP’s philosophy aligns with microservice principles – each service (server) manages its own data and state, and interactions happen through message passing (the protocol) rather than shared memory ([Outshift | MCP and ACP: Decoding the language of models and agents](https://outshift.cisco.com/blog/mcp-acp-decoding-language-of-models-and-agents#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20,agent%20systems)) ([Outshift | MCP and ACP: Decoding the language of models and agents](https://outshift.cisco.com/blog/mcp-acp-decoding-language-of-models-and-agents#:~:text=,not%20limited%20to%20tool%20calling)). This design choice improves modularity and maintainability: for instance, if your AI needs access to a new data source, you add a new MCP server for it without touching the core AI logic or other servers.

Before MCP, developers employed several strategies to give LLMs more context or tools, each with limitations:

- **Custom Integrations (one-off adapters):** The most common approach was writing custom code for each data source or API – essentially hardcoding the interaction. For example, one might write a Python function to fetch data from Google Drive and then pass it into the prompt, and another function to query a database, etc. This is labor-intensive and not reusable. As a result, frameworks like LangChain amassed large collections of tool wrappers for various services, but using them still required careful manual assembly in code ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=libraries%20like%20LangChain%20popularized%20the,The%20difference%20is%20where%20the)) ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=is%20powerful%2C%20but%20each%20tool,build%20an%20agent%E2%80%99s)). MCP addresses this by providing a *single integration framework* where new connectors can be dropped in and immediately used, saving development time ([MCP Explained: How This AI Protocol Saves 99% of Your Time | by Sebastian Buzdugan | Mar, 2025 | Stackademic](https://blog.stackademic.com/mcp-explained-how-this-ai-protocol-saves-99-of-your-time-572971529ca8?source=collection_archive---------8-----------------------#:~:text=Before%20MCP%3A)) ([MCP Explained: How This AI Protocol Saves 99% of Your Time | by Sebastian Buzdugan | Mar, 2025 | Stackademic](https://blog.stackademic.com/mcp-explained-how-this-ai-protocol-saves-99-of-your-time-572971529ca8?source=collection_archive---------8-----------------------#:~:text=3,Accuracy)). In essence, it shifts from writing N different integration scripts to simply configuring N MCP servers that all speak the same language to the AI.

- **Plugins for Language Models:** In 2023, OpenAI introduced *ChatGPT Plugins*, which allowed external services to declare an OpenAPI specification and some manifest, enabling ChatGPT to call those APIs in a controlled way. While a big step toward tool-use by AI, these plugins were platform-specific (only certain model providers supported them) and typically stateless request-response interactions ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=,source%20and%20universal)) ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=,implemented%20in%20a%20consistent%20interface)). Each plugin had to be individually created/hosted and the AI could use them mainly by generating an API call as output (one-way call). MCP differs by being **open and model-agnostic** – any provider or open-source model can implement it – and by supporting a richer, ongoing dialog between the AI and the tool ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=OpenAPI%20schema,the%20AI%20and%20tools%2C%20whereas)) ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=,answer%20calls)). MCP’s two-way streaming and persistent connection allow, for example, a long database transaction or an interactive tool use (multiple back-and-forth steps), which typical RESTful plugins did not. Nonetheless, plugins and MCP share a similar goal: standardizing how an AI can call external services. One can view MCP as a more general, open successor to the plugin concept, with support for **stateful sessions** rather than just stateless API calls ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=access,Agent%20orchestration)) ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=interactive%20session,implementation%20under%20the%20hood%20%E2%80%93)).

- **Agent Tool Frameworks (e.g. LangChain):** LangChain and similar libraries provided a way to define *tools* (functions) in code and have an LLM choose among them. LangChain created a *developer-facing standard* for a tool interface (name, description, Python function) which made it easy to plug new tools into an agent’s code ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=,MCP%20servers%20as%20a%20library)) ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=LangChain%E2%80%99s%20library%20grew%20to%20500%2B,build%20an%20agent%E2%80%99s)). MCP can be seen as complementary: it defines a *model-facing standard* at runtime ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=LangChain%E2%80%99s%20library%20grew%20to%20500%2B,build%20an%20agent%E2%80%99s)) ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=MCP%20can%20be%20seen%20as,connectors%29%20can)). In fact, one can integrate LangChain with MCP – and indeed, the LangChain team added support so that all MCP servers can be used as LangChain tools ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=defined%20tool%20at%20runtime,from%20the%20growing%20MCP%20ecosystem)). The key difference is, with LangChain alone, the agent’s developer must pre-register each tool in the code (and handle the logic of invoking it), whereas with MCP an agent can dynamically discover and use any MCP-defined tool even if the agent’s original code didn’t explicitly include it ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=yet%20developers%20still%20had%20to,In%20practice)) ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=of%20ready,agent%20built%20inLLangChain%20or%20other)). This dynamic ability is powerful for scaling – imagine an enterprise where dozens of new tools (MCP servers) could be added over time, and the AI agent can utilize them without code changes, because they all adhere to MCP. LangChain laid the groundwork by showing the utility of tools; MCP formalizes it in a shareable protocol.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** RAG refers to using a vector store or search index to fetch relevant text chunks which are then appended to the LLM’s prompt (augmenting its knowledge). This addresses the model’s knowledge cutoff or limited context window. However, RAG typically only *feeds information in* and is stateless each query (the model can’t ask follow-up questions to the retriever except via new queries). MCP is more general in that it allows not only information retrieval (akin to a more interactive, tool-based form of RAG – e.g. a search tool, a database query tool), but also performing actions. One commentary noted that *“RAG gives passive context, MCP lets the model actively fetch or act on context”* ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=%2A%20Retrieval,MCP%20lets%20the%20model%20actively)) ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=for%20instance%2C%20an%20MCP%20server,%E2%80%93%20it%20can%20trigger%20operations)). They can work together: for instance, an MCP server could interface with a vector database so that the model can issue search queries as a tool, rather than the host implicitly doing retrieval in the background. The historical context here is that methods like RAG, while useful, didn’t address things like *writing to* external systems or orchestrating multi-step tasks, which MCP set out to tackle.

It’s worth mentioning earlier research in **agent communication languages** from the AI community (1990s-2000s), such as **KQML** and **FIPA-ACL**. Those were attempts to create standards for how autonomous agents exchange messages, perform negotiations, or coordinate tasks. They introduced formal performatives (e.g. *inform*, *request*, *query*) for semantic agent communication. MCP is more narrow in scope – it’s not trying to be a full language for arbitrary agent dialogues or negotiations, but rather focusing on an agent’s interface with tools and data. In a sense, one could consider MCP a descendant of those ideas, but specialized for the case where one party is an LLM and the other is a resource/tool provider. Interestingly, the recent multi-agent protocols (Google’s A2A and Cisco’s ACP, discussed below) position themselves as successors to the spirit of FIPA-ACL for modern AI agents ([Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol: All About it in One Go - Medium](https://medium.com/data-and-beyond/agent2agent-a2a-protocol-all-about-it-in-one-go-ea1eb2d93de6#:~:text=,how%20A2A%20fits%20with)), while describing MCP as handling the *tool-use aspect* of agent design. Thus, MCP sits in a historical continuum of trying to formalize how components of an AI system communicate – learning from past lessons that adoption comes easier when the protocol is simple, developer-friendly, and solves immediate problems.

Finally, the design rationale included a strong emphasis on **open-source and community adoption**. By releasing MCP as an open specification (with an open governance model on GitHub) and providing many reference connectors, Anthropic intended to seed an ecosystem and encourage industry-wide uptake ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%27re%20introducing%20three%20major,Model%20Context%20Protocol%20for%20developers)) ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Early%20adopters%20like%20Block%20and,functional%20code%20with%20fewer%20attempts)). This open approach was likely a reaction to the proprietary nature of earlier solutions (OpenAI’s plugins, or closed product-specific integrations). Early in its announcement, Anthropic highlighted partnerships and collaboration (e.g. Microsoft contributed to the C# SDK, JetBrains to the Kotlin SDK ([Model Context Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol#:~:text=%2A%20kotlin)) ([Model Context Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol#:~:text=%2A%20java))) to signal that MCP is not meant to be locked to a single vendor. The goal is for MCP to become a **de facto standard** for AI-tool communication, much like HTTP is for web or USB-C for hardware (["We have 1 million subscribers in five days since we launched ...](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/world/11279966#:~:text=,as%20AI%20apps%20spread)) ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=framework%2C%20MCP%20is%20open%20and,delivered%20a%20workshop%20that%20went)). Many in the AI community see potential in this: *“the industry compares MCP to HTTP, which led to the rapid growth of the Internet”*, hoping MCP could similarly catalyze AI application growth by standardizing connectivity (["We have 1 million subscribers in five days since we launched ...](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/world/11279966#:~:text=,as%20AI%20apps%20spread)). Of course, whether it achieves ubiquitous adoption will depend on competing approaches and real-world results, which we turn to next.

## Integrating MCP in Agent Systems and LLM Workflows

One of MCP’s core use cases is in **agent systems** – setups where an LLM acts as an autonomous agent to perform tasks (possibly in multiple steps, possibly coordinating with other agents or services). Integrating MCP in such systems means using MCP for the agent’s tool and context needs. 

In a single-agent scenario, MCP serves as the **interface between the agent and its environment** (data/tools). For example, consider a personal assistant agent that can manage your calendar, files, emails, etc. Without MCP, you might hardcode that agent with specific API calls to Google Calendar, Gmail, etc. With MCP, each of those becomes an MCP server (Calendar server, Email server, etc.), and the agent simply treats them as available tools/resources. The *agent’s orchestrator (host)* would connect to these servers at startup. When the LLM needs to check your schedule, it will invoke the calendar tool via MCP; to send an email, it uses the email server’s tool, and so on. This greatly simplifies the agent’s code and makes it easy to add or remove capabilities by starting or stopping servers. It also allows for **third-party expansions** – e.g., an enterprise could have a custom MCP server for an internal knowledge base, and any agent built with MCP support (like Claude or an open-source agent) could immediately plug into it to gain that knowledge access.

An important point from Ali Arsanjani (one of the architects of Google’s A2A protocol) is that **MCP’s scope is internal to a single agent** – it governs the interface between an agent’s LLM core and its attached tools ([Complementary Protocols for Agentic Systems : Understanding Google’s A2A & Anthropic’s MCP | by Ali Arsanjani | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@dr-arsanjani/complementary-protocols-for-agentic-systems-understanding-googles-a2a-anthropic-s-mcp-47f5e66b6486#:~:text=Anthropic%E2%80%99s%20MCP%2C%20serves%20a%20specific,LLM%20within%20that%20single%20application)) ([Complementary Protocols for Agentic Systems : Understanding Google’s A2A & Anthropic’s MCP | by Ali Arsanjani | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@dr-arsanjani/complementary-protocols-for-agentic-systems-understanding-googles-a2a-anthropic-s-mcp-47f5e66b6486#:~:text=match%20at%20L79%20model%20,LLM%20within%20that%20single%20application)). In his example of a personal assistant agent, MCP was used to format and send information to the LLM (Claude) and interpret its responses when it wanted to use a tool ([Complementary Protocols for Agentic Systems : Understanding Google’s A2A & Anthropic’s MCP | by Ali Arsanjani | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@dr-arsanjani/complementary-protocols-for-agentic-systems-understanding-googles-a2a-anthropic-s-mcp-47f5e66b6486#:~:text=Structuring%20Interaction%20with%20the%20Language,Model)) ([Complementary Protocols for Agentic Systems : Understanding Google’s A2A & Anthropic’s MCP | by Ali Arsanjani | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@dr-arsanjani/complementary-protocols-for-agentic-systems-understanding-googles-a2a-anthropic-s-mcp-47f5e66b6486#:~:text=Functionally%2C%20MCP%20provides%20the%20blueprint,tool%20is%20executed%20by%20the)). Essentially, the agent’s *orchestrator* (the host logic) uses MCP to handle all communication with the LLM about tools: it uses MCP conventions to present the list of tools to the LLM (typically via a system message or context encoding), and it expects the LLM to respond with MCP-defined structures to indicate actions. Then the orchestrator maps those to actual MCP client requests to the servers. This creates a tight **feedback loop**: user query -> LLM -> LLM requests tool via MCP -> orchestrator executes via MCP -> result -> LLM -> final answer. MCP defines how each step is structured, which reduces ambiguity and error in parsing model outputs. The Arsanjani article illustrates this with a sequence: the user asks something, the orchestrator uses MCP formatting to include chat history + tool definitions in the prompt, the LLM responds with a *formatted request to use a tool*, the orchestrator executes it and formats the results back via MCP for the LLM to incorporate ([Complementary Protocols for Agentic Systems : Understanding Google’s A2A & Anthropic’s MCP | by Ali Arsanjani | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@dr-arsanjani/complementary-protocols-for-agentic-systems-understanding-googles-a2a-anthropic-s-mcp-47f5e66b6486#:~:text=includes%20formatting%20system%20prompts%20that,for%20further%20processing%20or%20summarization)) ([Complementary Protocols for Agentic Systems : Understanding Google’s A2A & Anthropic’s MCP | by Ali Arsanjani | Apr, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@dr-arsanjani/complementary-protocols-for-agentic-systems-understanding-googles-a2a-anthropic-s-mcp-47f5e66b6486#:~:text=To%20illustrate%2C%20consider%20a%20Personal,them%20back%20into%20the%20model%E2%80%99s)). In summary, integrating MCP in an agent means the agent’s internal communication with its LLM is standardized – the LLM essentially speaks a *mini-language* of MCP JSON to ask for tools or data, rather than relying on brittle prompt tricks. This yields more reliable and debuggable agent behaviors.

For multi-agent systems (where multiple autonomous agents need to talk to each other or coordinate), MCP can still play a role, but it is not sufficient alone. MCP is primarily about an agent interacting with **external resources**. If you want two separate agents (possibly from different organizations or built on different platforms) to collaborate, you need a protocol for agent-to-agent communication. That’s where protocols like Google’s **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** and Cisco’s **Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)** come in. These are complementary to MCP. As Cisco’s Outshift team explains, *“MCP focuses on enriching a model (agent) with external context, while ACP is about communication between agents”* ([Outshift | MCP and ACP: Decoding the language of models and agents](https://outshift.cisco.com/blog/mcp-acp-decoding-language-of-models-and-agents#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20,agent%20systems)) ([Outshift | MCP and ACP: Decoding the language of models and agents](https://outshift.cisco.com/blog/mcp-acp-decoding-language-of-models-and-agents#:~:text=,not%20limited%20to%20tool%20calling)). Similarly, Google’s A2A announcement explicitly states that A2A *“complements Anthropic’s MCP, which provides helpful tools and context to agents”* ([

In practical terms, this means if you have a scenario with multiple agents that need to negotiate or split tasks, you’d use A2A/ACP for their inter-agent messages, and each agent might internally use MCP to access its tools.

**Integration example:** Suppose you have two agents in a company: one is a *Travel Agent* (books flights/hotels) and another is a *Calendar Agent* (manages calendars and scheduling). If a user asks the Travel Agent to schedule a trip, the Travel Agent might need to coordinate with the Calendar Agent to avoid conflicts. Using A2A, the Travel Agent can send a message to the Calendar Agent saying “When is the user free in June for a 3-day trip?”; the Calendar Agent checks and replies with some dates. Meanwhile, each agent could be using MCP internally: the Travel Agent uses an MCP server for an airline booking system (tool: book_flight, resource: flight_options) and the Calendar Agent uses an MCP server for the company calendar system (tool: find_available_slot, etc.). A2A handles *agent-to-agent dialogue*, and MCP handles *agent-to-service interactions*. They operate at different layers: MCP is a *containment protocol* (within an agent’s boundary), A2A/ACP are *communication protocols* between separate agents ([Outshift | MCP and ACP: Decoding the language of models and agents](https://outshift.cisco.com/blog/mcp-acp-decoding-language-of-models-and-agents#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20,agent%20systems)) ([Outshift | MCP and ACP: Decoding the language of models and agents](https://outshift.cisco.com/blog/mcp-acp-decoding-language-of-models-and-agents#:~:text=,not%20limited%20to%20tool%20calling)).

For developers building agent systems, this layered approach means you might adopt MCP **and** something like A2A, depending on your needs. If your focus is a single powerful agent that can use many tools, MCP might be all you need. If you want a network of specialized agents working together, you’d introduce an inter-agent protocol too. It’s notable that both A2A and ACP are very new (announced in 2025) and are being developed openly with industry partners ([

This reflects a broader trend: the community is coalescing around standardized protocols at both levels of agent design.

**Integration with LLM Providers:** MCP is designed to be model-agnostic, and indeed you can integrate it with any large language model (Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-4/GPT-3.5, open-source models like Llama, etc.). The key requirement is that the *LLM client (host)* is able to format prompts and parse outputs according to MCP’s scheme. Anthropic’s own Claude has first-class support (Claude Desktop directly supports connecting MCP servers, and Claude’s SDK knows how to utilize tools via MCP), but others can follow. For example, developers have adapted OpenAI GPT-based agents to use MCP servers by parsing the model outputs for tool invocations that match the MCP format. There are already open-source client implementations and wrappers – e.g., the `fast-agent` project supports full MCP usage with OpenAI models, and the LangChain adapter allows using MCP servers as if they were LangChain tools in a GPT agent ([Example Clients - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients#:~:text=Daydreams%20Agents%E2%9C%85%E2%9C%85%E2%9C%85%E2%9D%8C%E2%9D%8CSupport%20for%20drop%20in,list%20and%20lookup%20through%20tools)) ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=defined%20tool%20at%20runtime,from%20the%20growing%20MCP%20ecosystem)). In short, **MCP can be seen as an *integration layer* in an LLM application stack**, sitting between the core model and the external world. It’s not tied to any one model or vendor, which is a deliberate design to encourage adoption ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=standard.%20,just%20release%20MCP%20and%20walk)). This decoupling also means you could swap out the underlying LLM (say from GPT-4 to an open-source model) and as long as your orchestrator logic remains the same, all the MCP-connected tools still work. This flexibility is valuable for organizations who want to avoid lock-in to a single AI API – MCP gives a common method to access their data regardless of which model is doing the reasoning ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#:~:text=MCP%20helps%20you%20build%20agents,and%20tools%2C%20and%20MCP%20provides)).

**Common Integration Strategies:** When implementing MCP in practice, here are a few patterns and tips that have emerged:

- *Local vs Remote Servers:* In early usage, many MCP servers run locally (especially for things like accessing local files, git repos, or internal systems). A local server can be launched as a subprocess by the host (using stdio transport) or as a background service. This has the advantage of low latency and simpler security (since everything is on one machine under user control). As MCP matures, more **remote servers** are expected – e.g., an organization might host an MCP server for a database on a secure server and allow agents to connect via HTTP transport with authentication. The MCP spec is open to custom transports as well, so in the future WebSocket or even P2P transports could appear ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=,yet)). For now, integrating an MCP server typically involves deciding if it runs in-process with the AI app (common for desktop apps) or as a separate service (common for cloud scenarios). Claude’s desktop app currently only supports local servers (one of the limitations noted by early users) ([Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Glama](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart#:~:text=,successfully%20used%20MCP%20on%20Windows)) ([Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Glama](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart#:~:text=,successfully%20used%20MCP%20on%20Windows)), but remote support is expected to expand.

- *Configuration and Discovery:* To connect to servers, a host needs to know what MCP servers are available. This is often done via config files or UI settings where servers are listed (with addresses or commands to start them). Some hosts might scan the environment – e.g., looking for certain well-known socket addresses or using service discovery to find MCP endpoints. Once connected, as mentioned, the capabilities are discovered dynamically. In a large environment, one could envision a “**marketplace**” or directory of MCP servers ([Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Glama](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart#:~:text=I%20don%27t%20expect%20MCP%20to,it%20has%20HTTP%20transport%20support)) ([Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Glama](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart#:~:text=However%2C%20I%20do%20imagine%20a,these%20services%20into%20their%20workflows)). Indeed, folks have speculated about marketplaces where users can drop in integrations (like an app store for AI tools). For now, integration is usually manual: e.g., a developer installs an MCP server package (from npm or pip – many are published as `@modelcontextprotocol/server-*` on npm or `mcp-server-*` on PyPI ([Example Servers - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples#:~:text=TypeScript,npx)) ([Example Servers - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples#:~:text=%23%20Using%20uvx%20uvx%20mcp))), runs it, and then tells their AI app to connect to it.

- *Securing Credentials and Access:* Many MCP servers need credentials (API keys, database passwords) to access the underlying service. A common integration practice is to **store those secrets in the environment or a config**, and have the server read them on startup. The host doesn’t need to know these secrets; it just communicates via MCP. This is good for security isolation. The MCP spec encourages careful handling of secrets and even suggests that clients and servers support *secure secret exchange* if needed ([Example Clients - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients#:~:text=match%20at%20L112%20tool%2Froots%20discovery%2C,Witsy%E2%9D%8C%E2%9D%8C%E2%9C%85%E2%9D%8C%E2%9D%8CSupports%20tools%20in%20Witsy)). Some SDKs provide conveniences for this (for example, a standardized way to configure OAuth tokens for the Google Drive server). When deploying an MCP server in production (say an enterprise setting), it’s important to ensure only authorized hosts can connect (perhaps by network controls or requiring an auth handshake in the protocol – which the base spec does not define, but one could layer on TLS with client certs or similar).

- *Orchestrator Logic:* The host’s orchestrator (the code that wraps around the LLM) needs to manage the flow of information from servers to the LLM. A common pattern is: on each turn or task, decide which resources to fetch and include in the prompt, and which tools to make available. Some hosts might automatically include *all* connected MCP servers’ offerings at all times, but this can overwhelm the model with options. A smarter strategy is **contextual activation** – e.g., if the user’s query is about code, enable the Git and filesystem servers; if it’s about scheduling, enable the Calendar server, etc. This could be done via simple rules or even using an AI classifier to predict relevant tools. The MCP framework itself doesn’t dictate this strategy but provides the means (the host can choose which tool descriptions to show the model, which resources to retrieve pre-emptively, etc.). Lessons from real deployments suggest that good orchestration logic is key to getting the most out of MCP: you want to supply relevant context but not too much noise to the model, and you want to let the model use tools when appropriate but avoid tangents. Developers have found it useful to log and monitor how the LLM is using the MCP tools – sometimes refining tool descriptions or adding user-facing controls when the model misuses a tool.

- *Testing and Debugging:* Incorporating MCP adds complexity, so testing each integration is important. Anthropic provided an **Inspector** tool for MCP (a visual testing interface) ([Model Context Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol#:~:text=TypeScript%20%205%2C444%20%20,Updated%20Apr%2019%2C%202025)) ([Model Context Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol#:~:text=)) which can simulate an MCP client or server to ensure the messages are correct. A recommended practice is to test each server in isolation (e.g., use the Inspector or a simple client script to call its functions) and each client in isolation (maybe connecting to a dummy server) before putting them together with an LLM in the loop. Some early adopters reported needing to iterate on prompt wording or tool design after observing the LLM’s behavior with the new tools (for instance, ensuring the tool’s description is clear so the model uses it correctly). MCP’s structured approach actually helps here, because it’s easier to detect where something went wrong in a chain: you can see if the model attempted a tool call (and with what arguments) and trace the response. Logging at the MCP protocol level is a lot clearer than parsing raw text transcripts.

## Real-World Deployments and Lessons Learned

Although MCP is relatively new, it has seen **early adoption** in both individual projects and enterprise settings. Notably, companies like **Replit, Codeium, Sourcegraph, Zed** (an IDE), and others collaborated as launch partners and integrated MCP to enhance their AI-based features ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=exploring%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20sharing%20pre,GitHub%2C%20Git%2C%20Postgres%2C%20and%20Puppeteer)) ([MCP Explained: How This AI Protocol Saves 99% of Your Time | by Sebastian Buzdugan | Mar, 2025 | Stackademic](https://blog.stackademic.com/mcp-explained-how-this-ai-protocol-saves-99-of-your-time-572971529ca8?source=collection_archive---------8-----------------------#:~:text=Replit%2C%20Codeium%2C%20and%20Sourcegraph%20have,to%20enhance%20their%20AI%20systems)). For example, Sourcegraph’s Cody (an AI coding assistant) can use MCP to access a codebase’s repository via a Git server, instead of relying only on what’s in the prompt window. Zed (a code editor) integrated MCP to let an AI assistant open and modify files in a project safely through a standardized interface ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=exploring%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20sharing%20pre,GitHub%2C%20Git%2C%20Postgres%2C%20and%20Puppeteer)). These real deployments show the benefit of **consistency**: rather than each of these tools writing their own plugin system or hardcoding an interface to git, they all use the same MCP Git server that was built once and is community-maintained.

**Performance and Efficiency:** One of the touted benefits is saving developer time – a blog post claimed MCP “saves 99% of your time” in setting up integrations (an obvious exaggeration, but the point is it *significantly* cuts down effort) ([MCP Explained: How This AI Protocol Saves 99% of Your Time | by Sebastian Buzdugan | Mar, 2025 | Stackademic](https://blog.stackademic.com/mcp-explained-how-this-ai-protocol-saves-99-of-your-time-572971529ca8?source=collection_archive---------8-----------------------#:~:text=MCP%20is%20an%20open%20protocol,LLMs)) ([MCP Explained: How This AI Protocol Saves 99% of Your Time | by Sebastian Buzdugan | Mar, 2025 | Stackademic](https://blog.stackademic.com/mcp-explained-how-this-ai-protocol-saves-99-of-your-time-572971529ca8?source=collection_archive---------8-----------------------#:~:text=At%20the%20heart%20of%20MCP,them%20adaptable%20for%20various%20environments)). Anecdotally, developers have found that using the pre-built connectors (dozens are available in the open-source repository ([Example Servers - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples#:~:text=Data%20and%20file%20systems)) ([Example Servers - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples#:~:text=%2A%20Git%20,io))) can turn what was a multi-day task into a few minutes of configuration. For instance, adding Slack integration might be as simple as running `uvx mcp-server-slack` (using the provided launcher) and inputting an API token, versus writing a custom Slack bot integration from scratch. This speed-up accelerates prototyping of AI workflows.

From a system performance angle, there is some overhead to using MCP (serialization, process communication). However, given that LLM calls themselves are comparatively heavy, the overhead is usually negligible in context. Servers are generally I/O-bound (waiting on an API or disk), so the JSON-RPC message passing is not a bottleneck. The **trade-off** is more about **complexity vs capability**: by introducing MCP servers, you gain modularity and power at the cost of running additional components. If someone’s use case was simple (e.g., just calling one Python function), they might find MCP overkill. But as needs scale up (multiple tools, possibly running out-of-process for safety), MCP’s architecture pays off.

**Adoption and Standardization:** One concern raised by observers was whether MCP will truly become a standard or remain tied to Anthropic’s ecosystem. Skeptics pointed out parallels to other AI tool initiatives that didn’t get widespread adoption. For example, Harrison Chase (@hwchase17, creator of LangChain) compared MCP to earlier innovations and questioned if it might end up *“provider exclusive”* ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=match%20at%20L194%20,Insights%3A%20%40pirroh%20reflects%20on%20MCP%27s)) ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=,Insights%3A%20%40pirroh%20reflects%20on%20MCP%27s)) – i.e., will other AI providers (like OpenAI or Google) embrace MCP, or will each push their own? Thus far, we’ve seen positive signs: many open-source projects and even other companies (like those in Google’s A2A partner list, which includes LangChain) are acknowledging MCP and ensuring compatibility. Microsoft’s participation in the C# SDK and JetBrains in Kotlin SDK suggests cross-industry interest ([Model Context Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol#:~:text=%2A%20kotlin)) ([Model Context Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol#:~:text=%2A%20java)). The hope is that MCP remains truly open and perhaps moves to a neutral governance (for now it’s on an open GitHub under modelcontextprotocol). For a developer investing time in building MCP clients/servers, the lesson is to design cleanly and perhaps keep an eye on evolving standards – but given MCP’s momentum, it’s a good bet for now.

**Lesson: Use Cases and Limitations:** Real-world usage has illuminated what MCP is *great* for and what it’s not. It excels at integrating **enterprise data sources** into AI assistants: things like connecting to Confluence/Wiki, databases, internal APIs, etc., where providing that data to an LLM can make it much more useful. Success stories include using MCP to give customer support bots access to live ticket databases, or enabling coding assistants to do “live” codebase queries and modifications with less hallucination. On the flip side, MCP by itself doesn’t solve deeper reasoning or reliability issues of LLMs – it provides them tools but the logic of when and how to use those tools is still something that needs careful prompt engineering or learning. One *limitation noted* early was that MCP initially only supported local connections (no cloud service out of the box) ([Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Glama](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart#:~:text=,successfully%20used%20MCP%20on%20Windows)) ([Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Glama](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart#:~:text=,successfully%20used%20MCP%20on%20Windows)). This meant an enterprise wanting to use MCP across machines had to hack around it. As of the latest spec (2025), HTTP transport is supported which addresses this, but robust authentication and remote management are areas for improvement as adoption grows.

Another lesson is about **user experience**: If the AI agent has too many tools via MCP, it might confuse the user or even the model. Some Hacker News commentators joked about the proliferation of standards (referencing the XKCD “Standards” comic) ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=The%20launch%20partners%20Zed%2C%20Sourcegraph%2C,is%20already%20recalling%20XKCD%20927)) – implying we should be cautious not to end up with a complex mess. The MCP team seems aware and is iterating with community feedback (for example, improving how Claude’s UI handles multiple servers, automating permissions, etc.). From the user’s perspective, ideally they don’t even need to know MCP is involved – they just see their AI assistant can suddenly do more (answer questions about their files, perform tasks in other apps, etc.). Achieving that seamless UX requires polishing things like auto-loading servers and giving meaningful names to capabilities (so the agent can explain “I’m going to use the *database lookup* tool now” in a user-friendly way).

**Ecosystem and Community:** MCP’s open-source repo of servers has grown quickly. There are reference connectors for popular services (Google Drive, GitHub, Slack, Postgres, Chrome/Puppeteer, etc.) ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Claude%203,GitHub%2C%20Git%2C%20Postgres%2C%20and%20Puppeteer)) ([Example Servers - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples#:~:text=Data%20and%20file%20systems)), and also many community-contributed servers for more niche tools (Spotify control, Kubernetes management, etc.) ([Example Servers - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples#:~:text=A%20growing%20ecosystem%20of%20community,servers%20extends%20MCP%E2%80%99s%20capabilities)). This burgeoning ecosystem confirms that developers find it worthwhile to contribute integrations that then everyone can use. A **community challenge** will be quality control – some community servers may be experimental or unvetted ([Example Servers - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples#:~:text=%2A%20Todoist%20,integration)). As MCP usage in critical apps grows, we might see a need for certification or at least documentation of which servers are stable and secure. Organizations like Outshift (Cisco) with their **AGNTCY** initiative are also looking at bridging MCP with multi-agent scenarios, and we might see consolidation or interoperability layers forming (for instance, an agent marketplace that includes both MCP tool-plugins and A2A agent services).

**Trade-offs and Future Work:** In deploying MCP, one trade-off to consider is **control vs autonomy**. MCP allows a user to retain control – e.g., they can choose which servers to enable. This is great for trust and safety, but it also means an out-of-the-box AI might not do anything until the user sets it up with the right servers (unlike a closed system that might have some built-in retrieval). For casual users, there’s a usability hurdle in manually configuring integrations. We expect future AI platforms to hide some of this complexity by shipping with default MCP servers or by auto-suggesting integrations. As MCP matures, areas of improvement include: richer** semantics for tools** (beyond basic name/description, maybe preconditions or richer type systems), better *multi-modal support* (some servers can provide images or audio; the protocol can carry binary data, but how the model uses it is another matter), and *optimization for large data streams* (if an MCP resource is huge, current JSON-RPC might be inefficient; maybe direct data channels or chunked streams could help).

In conclusion, the **Message/Model Context Protocol (MCP)** represents a significant step towards standardized AI integration. Its architecture – with MCP clients and servers modularizing an AI’s access to tools and information – addresses a real pain point in building advanced LLM-driven systems. The design choices of using JSON-RPC, drawing from LSP, and focusing on a narrow but critical scope (LLM <-> tool interface) give it a strong foundation. MCP is emerging alongside complementary protocols (like A2A for agent communication) in what some call the beginning of an “AI agent protocol stack.” While it’s not a silver bullet for all AI challenges, MCP **solves the integration problem in a principled way**, and early experiences show it can greatly accelerate development of powerful, context-aware AI agents. The coming years will test its adoption across the industry, but many observers are optimistic that MCP (or something very much like it) will become as ubiquitous for AI applications as HTTP is for web applications (["We have 1 million subscribers in five days since we launched ...](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/world/11279966#:~:text=,as%20AI%20apps%20spread)) ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=and%20any%20developer%20or%20company,the%20end%20of%20the%20article)).

## Conclusion and Resources

The Message/Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a foundational development in AI engineering, aiming to standardize how AI systems communicate with the world of data and services around them. By introducing a clear client–server architecture with well-defined interfaces (tools, resources, prompts) and leveraging established patterns (JSON-RPC, capability negotiation), MCP tackles the integration challenge in a robust way. It was designed to solve real issues – reducing duplicated integration work, keeping LLMs’ knowledge up-to-date, and enabling complex workflows – and early adopters have demonstrated its value in domains like coding assistants, enterprise chatbots, and personal AI agents.

For researchers and builders, MCP offers a rich area to explore: from protocol design nuances (e.g., how to craft tool schemas that an LLM can best understand) to system architecture (e.g., scaling a fleet of MCP servers in an organization). It also provides a **playground for experimentation** – given the open-source SDKs and example servers, one can quickly spin up a new integration and observe how an AI agent uses it. Such experiments yield insights into AI behavior: how does an LLM decide to use a tool when given one? How should we prompt it so it knows the tool exists? In many ways, MCP externalizes part of the AI’s “mind” – instead of baking everything into the model, some knowledge and capabilities live in these external modules that the model can query. This modularity will likely be important for creating AI systems that are maintainable and safe.

Those interested in MCP should check out the **official documentation and spec** (which is updated as the protocol evolves) ([Specification - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26#:~:text=Model%20Context%20Protocol%20,with%20the%20context%20they%20need)) ([Specification - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26#:~:text=MCP%20takes%20some%20inspiration%20from,the%20ecosystem%20of%20AI%20applications)). The **open-source repositories** are invaluable resources: the `modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol` repo contains the spec and docs, and the `modelcontextprotocol/servers` repo contains a plethora of ready-to-use connectors (as listed in the examples above) ([Model Context Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol#:~:text=)) ([Example Servers - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples#:~:text=Data%20and%20file%20systems)). Many of these repos have example code, and you can often find community tutorials or videos (for instance, developers like Alex Albert and Matt Pocock have created intro videos demonstrating MCP usage ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=,It)) ([[AINews] Anthropic launches the Model Context Protocol • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-anthropic-launches-the-model-context/#:~:text=The%20launch%20partners%20Zed%2C%20Sourcegraph%2C,is%20already%20recalling%20XKCD%20927))). Additionally, the Anthropic announcement blog ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%27re%20open,produce%20better%2C%20more%20relevant%20responses)) ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=MCP%20addresses%20this%20challenge,to%20the%20data%20they%20need)) and analysis posts by third parties (e.g., *Hugging Face’s* deep dive ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=standard.%20,ubiquitous%20standards%20in%20their%20domains)) ([#14: What Is MCP, and Why Is Everyone – Suddenly!– Talking About It?](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp#:~:text=,The%20difference%20is%20where%20the)), *Glama.ai’s* quickstart ([Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Glama](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart#:~:text=When%20large%20language%20models%20first,both%20local%20and%20remote%20resources)) ([Introducing Model Context Protocol (MCP) | Glama](https://glama.ai/blog/2024-11-25-model-context-protocol-quickstart#:~:text=High))) provide accessible overviews.

In summary, MCP represents the **convergence of ideas from AI assistants, software integration, and multi-agent systems** into a practical protocol. Its design reflects careful choices to balance flexibility, simplicity, and power: using JSON for readability, following LSP’s successful client-server pattern, and incorporating security from the ground up. As AI systems become more **“agentic”** – autonomously performing tasks and interacting with diverse tools – protocols like MCP will be what connect the reasoning of the AI to real-world action. The lessons learned so far (and to be learned in coming deployments) will no doubt refine MCP and perhaps influence related standards. For now, MCP offers a solid framework for anyone looking to build the next generation of AI applications that are deeply integrated, context-aware, and capable of engaging with the world far beyond their initial training.
